# Transparent-Data-Encryption-AS-OracleDB
 A method for encrypting "data at rest".
 "Data at Rest" - the true data which saved on physical data files never be encrypted. The Transparent Data Encryption feature will fix it, but it has some problems after encrypting, like the original data in the data file was not removed. So, using the "Online Redefinition" - Restructure the table will help you at all.
